Homework
You don’t need to create a new project. You may copy workshop/BankAccount Java class from the shared GitHub project into your own project and place it in a separate package (e.g., junit or unit_tests). 
Please keep the maven standard structure in mind:
•	source code: src/main/java
•	tests: src/test/java
Optionally, you can create a maven Java project, implement a BankAccount class with the methods deposit(), withdraw(), transferTo(), freeze() and write unit tests to cover them.
Homework deadline: Please submit your solution in Endava repository by EOD on Wednesday, October 1, 2025. 

What to cover in tests:
•	Constructor validation tests
•	Deposit/withdraw happy-path tests
•	All invalid-argument tests
•	Overdrawn check (should remain false for valid operations)
•	At least one Hamcrest assertion per scenario
•	(Optional) Parameterized tests, @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach
•	The test suite should be runnable via mvn test. Check the maven-surefire-plugin configuration (e.g., **/*Test.java patterns, Jupiter engine).
